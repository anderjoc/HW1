				<h1>Pyramid Web Framework</h1>
			</header>
			<div>
				<h2 id="background">What is Pyramid?</h2>
				<p>Pyramid is a Web framework that was created in December of 2010. It is part of 
					the Pylons Project and was a merger of Pylons and Repoze in which features 
					were added and removed to make it more useful for Pylons framework. The 
					concepts and features of Pyramid are inspired by Zope, Pylons, and Django. 
					Specific things that were taken from each include:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Zope - extensibility, traversal, and declarative security</li>
					<li>Pylons - URL dispatch, non-opinionated view of persistence, and templating</li>
					<li>Django - view and level of documentation</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Pyramid is considered to have a MVC (model-view-controller) framework, but it 
					doesn't use the MVC terminology. For example, instead of having "controllers" 
					(classes with methods that map to URLs), it has "views".</p>	
				<p>Pyramid has about 650 pages of thorough documentation on basic to advanced topics. 
					It is also a great framework to use for getting started on a project quickly as 
					you don't have to know a lot in order to start a project. Pyramid is also good 
					for prototyping concepts as well as for developing either small or large web 
					applications.</p>
			</div>

				<h2 id="tenants">Tenants of Pyramid</h2>
				<ol>
					<li>Simplicity - can use Pyramid and get results even if you only partially 
						understand it because there are a minimal number of core concepts</li>
					<li>Minimalism - it provides fast solutions to fundamental activities of 
						creating web applications</li>
					<li>Documentation - all aspects of Pyramid have up-to-date documentation</li>
					<li>Speed - it provides fast execution of common tasks</li>
					<li>Reliability - 100% of the content of Pyramid is tested</li>
					<li>Openness - it has a permissive open source license</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="system">System Requirements</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Python 2.6 or newer</li>
					<li>UNIX-like system (like Linux, MacOS X, and FreeBSD) or Windows platform</li>
					<li>Python interpreter</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="download">How to Download</h2>
				<p>Pyramid is installed in python development mode and can be installed on a virtual 
					environment. Instructions on how to download Pyramid on different systems or on a 
					virtual environment can be found <a href="http://docs.pylonsproject.org/projects/pyramid/en/1.3-branch/narr/install.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
					When Pyramid is installed, so are various libraries such as WebOb and PasteDeploy. 
					Scaffolds are also registered, which make it easy to start a new Pyramid project.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="pylons">Differences Between Pyramid and Pylons</h2>
				<p>Pyramid is a new framework that is different from the Pylons Web framework. However, 
					Pylons 1.0 code will run inside Pyramid through a fallback handler. For those who 
					currently use Pylons and may want to eventually switch to Pyramid, they should avoid 
					using global objects except in action methods and ensure all routes are explicit and 
					have a unique name.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="repoze">Differences Between Pyramid and repoze.bfg</h2>
				<p>Pyramid is based off repoze.bfg, but it has a new name and some new features. These 
					new features come from what was added from Pylons 1.0. Users who want to make the 
					switch from repoze.bfg to Pyramid don't have to make any changes and can use an automated 
					porting process to make the conversion.</p>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="sample">Sample Code: Hello World!</h2>
				<img src="code1.png">
				<p>Pyramid prides itself in the simple code that is required to create a webpage that displays 
					"Hello World!" It is as simple as creating a file named <code>helloworld.py</code> that contains the 
					above code. It is then run in a Python interpreter that has Pyramid installed using the 
					code seen below. When a local browser is opened to <link>http://localhost:8080/hello/world</link>, 
					"Hello World!" will be displayed.</p>
				<img src="code2.png">
				<p>The helloworld.py file does three things:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Imports the needed classes</li>
					<li>Defines the function and returns a response</li>
					<li>Configures the application and specifies where to serve it</li>
				</ol>
			</div>
			<div>
				<h2 id="more">More Useful Attributes of Pyramid</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Faster than other Python frameworks</li>
					<li>Has a "Cookbook" of demonstrations of common integration scenarios and Pylonsproject.org has tutorials and information</li>
					<li>Can write single-file applications, which is great for debugging</li>
					<li>Has a debugging toolbar as well as debugging settings that notify when something is wrong</li>
					<li>Paster has templates that can quickly build the skeleton of the infrastructure for several types of Web applications</li>
					<li>Can generate URLs</li>
					<li>Can use many different databases including SQLAlchemy, Zope Object Database, and other NoSQL databases</li>
					<li>Commits at the end of a request or aborts if there's an exception so bad changes or requests won't be committed</li>
					<li>Can use add-ons that provide additional functionality</li>
					<li>Can use extensible templating (including Mako, Genshi, Chameleon, and Jinja2) and can even use multiple templating systems in one project</li>
					<li>Can use multiple Python Packages</li>
					<li>Has a flexible pluggable authentication system</li>
					<li>Has traversal with a tree of resources with different associated views (i.e. managers have a different view than employees)</li>
					<li>Can subscribe to listen to Pyramid events or your own that you create</li>
					<li>Composed of the best features from other Python Web frameworks</li>
				</ul>
