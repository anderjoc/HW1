			<h1>About the Author</h1>
			<p>Jocelynn Anderson is a Masters student in Civil and Environmental Engineering 
				at Brigham Young University (BYU) with an emphasis in hydrology and hydroinformatics.
				She earned her Bachelor's degree in April of 2013 in Civil and Environmental 
				Engineering from BYU. During her undergraduate studies she 
				started working with the <a href="http://ci-water.org/" target="_blank">CI-WATER</a> group, with which she is now doing her Masters 
				research. She is helping develop an online app that will allow users to change the 
				land use of an area and run a storm model to see how the change affects flooding and 
				runoff.</p>
			<p>Jocelynn has been involved in a lot of groups and activities while she has been studying at BYU. 
				She is now an active member of the BYU Section of the Society of Women Engineers after she has 
				served as Historian, Vice-President, and President for BYU. She is also actively involved in Tau 
				Beta Pi and has been serving as the Utah Beta Section Treasurer during this past year. In addition, 
				she has been serving on the Graduate Student Society Council and has helped plan and host activities 
				for Graduate Students and their families.</p>
			<p>Jocelynn is also very involved in the BYU Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers. She 
				often participates in service projects and has also been involved in Rocky Mountain Conference. During 
				the third year of her undergraduate degree she participated in the Pre-Design Competition and helped BYU take second place with a water wheel made of a hula hoop and plastic cups. 
				She participated in the Concrete Canoe Team for three years and was the Paddling Captain her final year.
				Highlights of her involvement involve building the canoe, writing the paper, paddling through an icy Utah Lake, 
				paddling in the races at the conference, and finding any reason possible to jump in frigid water for a swim.</p>
			<p>In her spare time Jocelynn likes to dance, play piano, cook, cross stitch, hike, cycle, figure skate, 
				and learn new things. Although she just broke her leg and ankle, she is excited for the day that she can do 
				ballet, cha cha, swing, and country dance again. She also loves to find opportunities to serve and really enjoys doing family 
				history work.</p>
