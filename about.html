					at Brigham Young University (BYU) with an emphasis in hydrology and hydroinformatics.
					She earned her Bachelor's degree in April of 2013 in Civil and Environmental 
					Engineering from BYU. During her undergraduate studies she 
					started working with the <a href="http://ci-water.org/" target="_blank">CI-WATER</a> group, with which she is now doing her Masters 
					research. She is helping develop an online app that will allow users to change the 
					land use of an area and run a storm model to see how the change affects flooding and 
					runoff.</p>

					Jocelynn is also very involved in the BYU Section of the American Society of Civil Engineers. She 
					often participates in service projects and has also been involved in Rocky Mountain Conference. During 
					the third year of her undergraduate degree she participated in the Pre-Design Competition and helped BYU take second place with a water wheel made of a hula hoop and plastic cups. 
					She participated in the Concrete Canoe Team for three years and was the Paddling Captain her final year.

					In her spare time Jocelynn likes to dance, play piano, cook, cross stitch, hike (especially in the beauty of Canada), cycle, figure skate, 
					and learn new things. Although she just broke her leg and ankle, she is excited for the day that she can do 
					ballet, cha cha, swing, and country dance again. She also loves to find opportunities to serve and really enjoys doing family 
					history work. One of her favorite service projects she's had the opportunity to do thus far in her life was to go to the 
					Dominican Republic for a week to determine whether they could build a dam on one of their rivers. She had a great time and 
					fell in love with the people and their culture.</p>
